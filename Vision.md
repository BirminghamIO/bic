The idea that 'someone' should make an information resource that can act as a Frequently Asked Questions file for people who aspire to be members of the 'Birmingham & Midland' tech community has been floating in the air for a while. It usually feels easier to answer the current question one more time than to do the extra bit of work necessary to not ever have to answer it again. A WIKI might do the job but:

Many of us seem really sick of:

Political liars.

Nationalism, anti-ethnic feelings and "Strong Leaders" before 'good ideas'. Evidence suggests people are neither equal nor deserving of a massively greater share of the world's resources. Maybe there could be balance?

Hierarchical data structures and the belief that everything can be simplified by dividing into classes and categories.

The centralised power in Europe, Westminster, the West Midlands Metro Mayor or multi-national companies. Cultural values are increasingly shared internationally. Information flow has a network topology.


A 'Midland Information Cluster' seems an opportunity for low risk experiments in distributed, non-hierarchical, power structures based on co-operation rather than competition and might allow trials of digital democracy. We can do it without the approval of politicians. 'Strong leaders' say, "Bring me a solution, not a problem". If we can work out how to do that, we won't need them  telling us what to do. We can what we do in common and all benefit.

Hierarchical control structures grew from the inadequacy of the communication technology of feudal societies to cope with battlefield chaos. Modern warfare is conducted by networks of autonomous cells but most business culture has failed to follow their lead. Are we even in a battle? Who with and why? The Midland area has a history of radical change while being highly productive, so why stop now?

"First they came for the list of coffee shops..." etc. That will be useful but maybe we can take things further, in a series of low-cost iterations and show our collective expertise. We won't know if we don't try.
