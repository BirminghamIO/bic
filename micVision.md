## Answers to Frequently Asked Questions

The idea that 'someone' should make an information resource that can act as a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file for people who aspire to be members of the 'Birmingham & Midland' tech community has been floating in the air for a while. It usually feels easier to answer the current question one more time than to do the extra bit of work necessary to not ever have to answer it again. A WIKI might do the job but:

## Bigger Issues

Many of us in the community seem very sick of:

- Post-truth politics.

- Nationalism, anti-ethnic feelings and "Strong Leaders" before 'good ideas'. Evidence suggests people are neither equal nor deserving of a massively greater share of the world's resources. Maybe there could be balance?

- Hierarchical power structures and the belief that everything can be simplified by dividing people into classes and categories.

- The centralised power in Europe, Westminster, the West Midlands Metro Mayor or multi-national companies. Cultural values are increasingly shared internationally. Information flow has a network topology.

## An Experiment in New Architectures for Communication & Power

Westminster has forced a change from a Centralised to a Decentralised power relationship with Birmingham, like the Romans did on tribal chiefs. It appears different but is an extra layer of hierarchy with a single point of failure at the top and a tree to climb.

Tree structures grew from the inadequacy of the communication technology of feudal societies to cope with battlefield chaos. Modern warfare is conducted by networks of autonomous cells but most business culture has failed to follow their lead. Are we even in a battle? Who with and why? The Midland area has a history of radical change while being highly productive, so why stop now?

We could go further - a Distributed network topology where we relate to other regions, not just London.

A 'Midland Information Cluster' is an opportunity for low risk experiments in distributed power structures based on co-operating rather than competing with other cities and regions. We could experiment with small trials of digital democracy for decision making. We can do it without seeking the approval of politicians, creating an alternate political structure in parallel. 'Strong leaders' say, "Bring me a solution, not a problem" not realising that if we can work out how to do that, we don't need their tree-climbing skills.

"First they came for the list of coffee shops..." etc. Data will be useful but maybe we can take things further, in a series of low-cost iterations and demonstrate Midland's collective expertise. We won't know if we don't try.
