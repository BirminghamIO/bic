##Stage 1 - Find or create some data
### Initial Requirements Envisioning
We want to store some simple data about coffee shops, workspaces, interest groups etc.
### Initial Architectural Envisioning
micMap is a UML model of what data we think should exist and where it is once we have it.
'Lists' - Text files containing the raw information, Markdown and JSON have been mentioned.
ListOfLists.md is an index into the lists.
