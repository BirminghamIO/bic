#Contributions to the Midland Information Cluster
The MIC has begun as a few lists and links to artifacts that exist elsewhere. 
The data isn't 'live' in any other way, as far as we know, so we haven't felt the need for a branching strategy yet.

So far, we have followed the 'Forking' Workflow.

Everyone 'in the community' is welcome to create new data in the existing files, via git, as long as they are confident it is correct and of interest to the Birmingham & Midland tech community or to put forward ideas.
We are still working on what the format of the data needs to be and what we are going to do with it.
The MIC is discussed on birmingham.io and the BrumTech Slack team #mic channel.
