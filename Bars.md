# Bars & Public Houses

This file originally contained the list but this has been converted to .json entries in the following format:

  {  
    "name": "The Jeckyl & Hide",  
    "address": "28 Steelhouse Lane, City Centre, Birmingham",  
    "postcode": "B4 6BJ",  
    "tempArea": "City Centre",  
    "url": "http:////www.thejekyllandhyde.co.uk/"  
  },

The file was divided into sections by area.
That data is currently held in the field "tempArea" but will subsequently be replaced by latitude and longitude fields so we can calculate alternative area schemes, such as post-code. 

We had a section for:

Edgbaston / Birmingham University

but there were no bars added there yet, so it's preserved here.
