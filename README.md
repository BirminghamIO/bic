Midland Information Cluster
----
The 'mic' is an idea of a distributed network of information resources, ideally held in common ownership by those in the Birmingham & Midland 'tech, design & startups' community, to be used by anyone who finds it useful.  
  
It is being developed incrementally, starting from a map of the kind of information someone new to the community might want

e.g. Where are coffee shops that I can work in?  
Can I hire offices in an area near a creche?  
Where do I go to hear a talk on The Latest Really Cool Thing?  
What do people do when they aren't working?  
Where is nice/cheap to live?
  
@Woo started with micMap.xmi, a UML model of 'a Midland Information Cluster' (currently undefined) that doesn't exist and a request to the community to help 'make it so' (or something a bit like it.) micMap was created in KDE Umbrello which is a bit flaky so you can just look at the .PNG files of each view and log comments or change requests to micMapChange.md

We decided to start by gathering data by creating a few lists. Please see ListOfLists.md if you'd like to get involved in creating things. If you create a list that isn't on micMap, please add it to ListOfLists.md and micMapChange.md
