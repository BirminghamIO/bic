List Of Lists

We need lists of:

Technologies we use - TechList.md  
Coffee (or tea) shops - CoffeeShops.md  
Places where tech Meetups can be run.  
Pubs where you might bump into someone from the community.
Universities and studenty things.
Maker places.

Pointers

Maybe we already have:

A vision document - Vision.md  
A list of tech companies - Silicon Canal  
List of community members - birmingham.io + Slack   
Where do we chat on-line? - Slacks...

(Please feel free to add more of anything.)
